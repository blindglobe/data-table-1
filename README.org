#+title: Numeric table

* Aim

  Replicate and expand functionality provided by Chapter 27 of
  "Practical Common Lisp" for a data-structure more oriented towards
  numerical data.

  

* COLUMN-MAJOR-TABLE

  Stores data that is organized by columns, each column having a name
  and storing values of a one type.

* Architecture

  I see this library supporting several types of internal data
  formats.  They will be unified by a uniform interface (as much as
  possible).  To that end, there is a section of the library that
  deals with base class and generic function definitions.

  These are then specialized for various table types.

  Currently, I support only one table type, ~column-major-table~.
  The data is stored as nested vectors.  Top level vector holds the
  columns.  Each column is stored in a vector.
