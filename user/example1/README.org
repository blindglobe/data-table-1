The files in this directory provide examples of use of numeric-tables.
US population data in the period 1610-2010 is used to show examples of
queries, selection, fitting and interpolation (using GSLL).  The table
has some empty cells.  We use interpolated values to fill them.
Solar sunspot data is used to demonstrate power spectrum calculations
using the GSLL's fft.

  - example-w-native-arrays.lisp :: basic usage: 
    - Read from file
    - Queries
    - Selections
    - Dealing with empty data
  - example-w-foreign-arrays.lisp :: Tables that store data in
       foreign-arrays.  Replicates examples of examples in previous files
  - example-w-interpolation.lisp :: Examples of fitting and setting
       empty values with fitted ones.
  - example-w-fitting.lisp :: Examples of linear and non-linear
       fitting
  - example-w-fft.lisp :: Power spectrum of the solar sunspot number data

Interpolation and fitting results are shown in png files.

I used code comments and documentation strings to highlight how to
use numeric-tables in data analysis.
