The files in this directory provide examples of use of numeric-tables.
US population data in the period 1610-2010 is used to show examples of
queries, selection, fitting and interpolation (using GSLL).  The table
has some empty cells.  We use interpolated values to fill them.

  - example-w-native-arrays.lisp :: basic usage: 
    - Read from file
    - Queries
    - Selections
    - Dealing with empty data
  - example-w-foreign-arrays.lisp :: Tables that store data in
       foreign-arrays.  Replicates examples of examples in previous files
  - example-w-interpolation.lisp :: Examples of fitting and setting
       empty values with fitted ones.
  - example-w-fitting.lisp :: Examples of linear and non-linear
       fitting

Interpolation and fitting results are shown in png files.

I used code comments and documentation strings to highlight how to
use numeric-tables in data analysis.
